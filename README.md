1. [Insidious_The_Red_Door](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13405778/)
    The door becomes the key to unlocking the memories Dalton and his dad swore to forget years ago. But without the proper context, the memories only confuse Dalton more. He finds himself drawing the Red Door once again, but this time, there is a man standing in front of it holding a hammer.

     The Red Door is introduced in the first Insidious film through young Dalton’s drawings, which are his way of making sense of what he thinks are nightmares, but are, in fact, the result of his spirit walks. The Red Door is the barrier between the Further and a place even further beyond the world of the living, where the most tormented souls exist. It is also the entryway to the lair of the powerful Lipstick-Face Demon that Dalton refers to as “the man with the fire in his face.” In Insidious, Dalton is trapped there and only escapes thanks to his dad, who is able to pry his son away from the red-faced demon, but fails to seal the door behind him, giving the demon continued access to their world.

The sisters' reunion is cut short by the discovery of a mysterious book deep in the bowels of Ellie's building, giving rise to flesh-possessing demons, and thrusting Beth into a primal battle for survival as she is faced with the most nightmarish version of motherhood imaginable
